Melanocytic Nevi
Melanocytic Nevi is usually a non-cancerous disorder of pigment-producing skin cells and is commonly called birthmarks or moles.

Symptoms 
•	They may arise on any part of the body.
•	They differ in appearance depending on the body site.
•	They may be flat or protruding.
•	They vary in color from pink or flesh tones to dark brown, steel blue, or black.
•	Light-skinned individuals tend to have light-coloured naevi and dark-skinned individuals tend to have dark brown or black naevi.
•	Although mostly round or oval in shape, moles are sometimes unusual shapes.
•	They range in size from a couple of millimetres to several centimetres in diameter.

Causes
•	People with many melanocytic naevi tend to have family members that also have many similar lesions.
•	Somatic mutations in RAS genes are associated with congenital melanocytic naevi.
•	New melanocytic naevi may erupt following the use of BRAF inhibitor drugs (vemurafenib, dabrafenib).
•	People living in Australia and New Zealand have many more naevi than their relatives residing in Northern Europe.
•	Immunosuppressive treatment leads to an increase in the numbers of naevi.

Treatments
Most cases don't require treatment, but some cases require removal of the mole.

Melanoma
Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells (melanocytes) that give color to your skin.
Symptoms 
•	A change in an existing mole
•	The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin

Causes
•	Excessive ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.
•	Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation
•	Having many moles or unusual moles
•	A family history of melanoma.
•	Weakened immune system.
Prevention 
•	Avoid the sun during the middle of the day
•	Wear sunscreen year-round
•	Wear protective clothing.
•	Become familiar with your skin so that you'll notice changes.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the stage
Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, medication, or in some cases, chemotherapy.

Basal cell carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma can look different. You may notice a skin growth in a dome shape that has blood vessels in it. It can be pink, brown, or black.
At first, a basal cell carcinoma comes up like a small "pearly" bump that looks like a flesh-colored mole or a pimple that doesn’t go away.
Symptoms
•	Skin lesion
•	redness 
•	loss of colour
•	small bump
•	swollen blood vessels in the skin, or ulcers
Causes
•	Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or from a tanning bed are the main cause of basal cell carcinoma.
•	When UV rays hit your skin, over time, they can damage the DNA in your skin cells. The DNA holds the code for the way these cells grow. Over time, damage to the DNA can cause cancer to form. The process takes many years.
Treatments/Remedies
Treatments include prescription creams or surgery to remove the cancer. In some cases radiation therapy may be required.
•	Avoid too much sun. Stay out of sunlight between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun's UVB burning rays are strongest.
•	Use sunscreen. The sun’s UVA rays are present all day long -- that’s why you need daily sunscreen. Make sure you apply sunscreen with at least a 6% zinc oxide and a sun protection factor of 30 to all parts of the skin that aren't covered up with clothes every day. You also need to reapply it every 60 to 80 minutes when outside.
•	Dress right. Wear a broad-brimmed hat and cover up as much as possible, such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants.

Benign keratosis
 It is considered a chronic form of eczema, seborrheic dermatitis appears on the body where there is a lot of oil-producing (sebaceous) glands like the upper back, nose, and scalp.
Symptoms 
•	scaly, greasy patches on scalps
•	redness
•	swelling
•	Greasy scaling around the nose and in and around the eyebrows, on the mid-chest, upper back, and in the armpits and groin area.
Causes
•	stress
•	hormonal changes or illness
•	harsh detergents, solvents, chemicals and soaps
•	cold, dry weather
•	some medications, including psoralen, interferon and lithium
Treatment: Treatment depends on the severity
Treatment involves self-care and medicated shampoos, creams and lotions. Repeated treatments may be necessary.
Following a skincare routine can help keep symptoms under control. Wash affected areas daily with a gentle, zinc-containing cleanser (2% zinc pyrithione) and follow up with a moisturizer. Healthy lifestyle habits, like managing stress and getting plenty of sleep, can also improve skin.

Actinic keratosis
An actinic keratosis (ak-TIN-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a rough, scaly patch on the skin that develops from years of sun exposure. It's often found on the face, lips, ears, forearms, scalp, neck or back of the hands.
Symptoms
Actinic keratoses vary in appearance. Signs and symptoms include:
•	Rough, dry or scaly patch of skin, usually less than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter
•	Flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin
•	In some cases, a hard, wartlike surface
•	Color variations, including pink, red or brown
•	Itching, burning, bleeding or crusting
•	New patches or bumps on sun-exposed areas of the head, neck, hands and forearms

Causes
Actinic keratosis is caused by frequent or intense exposure to UV rays from the sun or tanning beds.

Prevention
•	Limit your time in the sun. 
•	Use sunscreen.  
•	Avoid tanning beds. .
•	Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor.  

Dermatofibromas
Dermatofibromas are small, harmless growths that appear on the skin. These growths, or papules, can develop anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the arms, lower legs, and upper back.
Symptoms
•	Appearance: A dermatofibroma presents as a round bump that is mostly under the skin.
•	Size: The normal range is about 0.5–1.5 centimeters (cm), with most lesions being 0.7–1.0 cm in diameter. The size will usually remain stable.
•	Color: The growths vary in color among individuals but will generally be pink, red, gray, brown, or black.
•	Location: Dermatofibromas are most common on the legs, but they sometimes appear on the arms, trunk, and, less commonly, elsewhere on the body.
•	Additional symptoms: Although they are usually harmless and painless, these growths may occasionally be itchy, tender, painful, or inflamed.
Treatment
Most dermatofibromas do not require treatment. A person can safely leave them alone, and they will usually cause no symptoms aside from their appearance on the skin.


Vascular Lesions
Vascular lesions are relatively common abnormalities of the skin and underlying tissues, more commonly known as birthmarks. There are three major categories of vascular lesions: Hemangiomas, Vascular Malformations, and Pyogenic Granulomas. While these birthmarks can look similar at times, they each vary in terms of origin and necessary treatment.
